# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the TypeScript language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment
Following this tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBmrduvKl5w) I initially built the app framework by hand, but then redid it with snowpack.
The relevant snowpack readme is included just below, for my own reference:
> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).
## Available Scripts
### npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
### npm run build
Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

I'm using javascript and typescript for this- React was also required for a different part of the learning process, but was not used for the final project.

# Useful Websites
The following are some of the sites I used for reference and tutorials initially tried to follow.

- I initially wanted to build a brick-breaker game following this tutorial: [Freecodecamp Arkanoid Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bejSTim38A&t=163s) But it was a. very old and b. already came with most of the code pre-written, which wouldn't do much to help me learn to write it.

# Future Work

I plan to keep working with typescript in the future, and I plan to add more functionality in the form of:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
