# Overview

I'm trying to learn TypeScript to expand my versatility- it's slow going, but definitely interesting!

I initially wanted to make a game, but I had a time limit, so this was the next best thing, and I initially wanted to make it because it would be easy to tell if I'd done everything right.

It was purely a learning exercise- I wanted to see if I could do it, and how long it would take. It also gives me a basic understanding of some things I know I'll use in future projects, like a D&D character sheet populator.

# Development Environment
Following this tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBmrduvKl5w) I initially built the app framework by hand, but then redid it with snowpack.
The relevant snowpack readme is included just below, for my own reference:
> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).
## Available Scripts
### npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
### npm run build
Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

I'm using javascript and typescript for this- React was also required for a different part of the learning process, but was not used for the final project.

# Useful Websites
The following are some of the sites I used for reference and tutorials initially tried to follow.

- I initially wanted to build a brick-breaker game following this tutorial: [Freecodecamp Arkanoid Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bejSTim38A&t=163s) But it was a. very old and b. already came with most of the code pre-written, which wouldn't do much to help me learn to write it.

# Future Work

I plan to keep working with typescript in the future, and I plan to add more functionality in the form of:

- Fixing the current nonfunctionality in the list-making portion
- Possible gamification- I'd love to have a cute little character or emoji to reward users for completing tasks
- Better formatting, or maybe different ways of reporting/recording tasks
